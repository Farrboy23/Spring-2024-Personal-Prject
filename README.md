**Credit Risk Analysis using Machine Learning**

*About/Overview*

This project aims to predict credit risk using machine learning models, specifically utilizing an XGBoost classifier. It is part of a broader initiative to enhance the decision-making processes of financial institutions regarding credit lending. The model is trained on the German Credit Data dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is designed to predict the probability of risk associated with credit applicants.

*Features*

Data preprocessing and feature scaling.
SMOTE for handling imbalanced data.
Hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV.
Model evaluation with precision-recall, ROC curves, and calibration plots.
Visualization of model's feature importance and predicted probabilities distribution.

*Installation*

To run this project, please install the following Python libraries. Use the package manager pip to install the required libraries:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost seaborn imbalanced-learn matplotlib

*Usage*

The code is structured as a script that can be run to perform the entire modeling process from data loading to evaluation. Ensure that you have downloaded the dataset and placed it in an accessible directory.

*Data*

The data used for this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository - Statlog (German Credit Data) Dataset.

*Contributing*

Contributions to improve the model or extend its functionality are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
